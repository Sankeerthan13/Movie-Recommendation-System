# Movie Recommendation System

A movie recommendation system built in Python that processes movie metadata, converts text features into numerical vectors using NLP techniques, calculates similarity scores with cosine similarity, and returns ranked movie recommendations based on content similarity.

## Overview

- **Objective:** Provide personalized movie recommendations to users based on their watch history and liked lists.
- **Techniques Used:**
  - Content-Based Filtering
  - User Behavior Analysis

## Project Highlights

1. **Content-Based Filtering:**
   - Utilized content-based filtering to recommend movies based on the attributes and features of the movies themselves.
   - Incorporated movie genres, actors, directors, and other metadata for content-based recommendations.

2. **Watch History:**
   - Analyzed user watch history to suggest movies that align with their viewing patterns and preferences.

3. **Liked List-Based Recommendations:**
   - Implemented a feature that allows users to like specific movies, enhancing the recommendation accuracy based on their favorites.

4. **Hybrid Approach:**
   - Integrated both content-based filtering and user behavior analysis to create a robust recommendation system.
   - Improved recommendation accuracy by considering both the movie attributes and user preferences.
